# DistributeD - The Distribute Daemon


This is old code that I've periodically worked on. Long ago, the goal was to have a client running on each of my machines (which at the time all ran different distros) which connected to a master server and periodically sent updates (uptime, mem usage, sensor readings, etc). The server could also send files with commands to execute (source code which would be compiled and run) and the resulting output would be sent back to the server. 

This code has gone through countless rewrites, revisons, redesigns, etc into what it is in now. Its a work in progress with an end goal that is in flux.
